Row class is a widget that displays its children horizontally.

Padding class is a widget that insets its child by the given padding.

By running the demo, you will be able to learn how the Row and Padding widgets are combined to control the space between your widgets horizontally.

To run this demo:
1. Confirm that you have Flutter installed on your computer.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run flutter pub get to install dependencies and flutter run to launch the app on your chosen emulator.
4. You can easily comment in and out certain aspects of the code to understand specific widget aspects. For example, comment out Padding to focus on the different attributes the Row widget has.

Widget attributes demonstrated:

For Row, there is the mainAxisAlignment attribute which controls how children are aligned along the main axis (horizontally within the row), and the children attribute which is the list of widgets that will be organized horizontally in the row.

For Padding, there is the EdgeInsets which is the amount of space to inset the child and its properties. There is also the child attribute which is the widget to apply padding to.
